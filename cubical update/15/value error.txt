while training a model i'm getting an error "ValueError: Error when checking input_1 to have 4 dimensions but got array of shape (0,1)" how to solve this and where it possibly occurring 

The error message indicates that the input data to your model is not in the expected shape. The model is expecting input data with 4 dimensions, but it is getting an array with shape (0,1). The (0,1) shape suggests that there are no samples in the input data, so it is likely that there is an issue with how you are loading or preprocessing your data.

To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:

Check the shape of your input data to make sure it matches the expected shape of the model. You can print the shape of your input data using the shape attribute of the numpy array.

Check the code that loads and preprocesses your data to make sure it is working correctly. Make sure that you are not accidentally removing any samples from the input data.

Make sure that the data you are passing to the model is not empty. If there are no samples in the input data, the model will not be able to process it.

If you are using data generators, make sure that they are generating data in the expected format.

If you are using Keras as your deep learning framework, make sure that you are passing the correct input shape to the first layer of your model.

Once you have identified the source of the issue, you can modify your code accordingly to resolve the error.
